Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to assist Bobby, an HR analyst, prepare for the “silver tsunami” at his company Pewlett Hackard. A large number of employees is expected to begin retiring in the next few years and Bobby needs to know how many employees will retire and what job openings will need to be filled. He also needs to determine which employees will be eligible for the retirement package.

Retiring Employees:

In the first analysis, we determined how many employees were born between 1952 and 1955 and are therefore, nearing retirement age. When running the code, we can see that:

-Over 72,000 employees will be retiring in the next few years.

-Of the employees retiring, many hold senior level positions, with “senior engineer” and “senior staff” being the job titles with the highest rate of upcoming retirement.

Mentorship Program

The second analysis is used to determine which employees are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. When executing this code, it is shown that:

-1,549 employees are eligible for this program.

-The majority of the eligible employees also hold a senior level position.

Summary

In this analysis, we were tasked with answering two questions: How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

There are 72,458 job openings that will need to be filled in the next few years. There are 1,549 employees that are mentorship eligible, which is not enough employees in each department able to help mentor the next generation.

One thing to note also, is that of the 72,458 job that will become available in the next few years, many of them are high ranking positions. The “Senior Staff” and “Senior Engineer” positions alone make up 50,842 of the job openings, which is over 70%. This is most likely because long-standing employees tend to get promoted as they remain within the company and older persons are more likely to hold these senior level jobs.

One way to address the shortage of mentors is to expand the pool of participants to choose from. Currently, there are 1,549 employees eligible. However, this is just from a selection of employees born during the year 1965. If we expand this to include employees born in 1966 and even 1967, the number of employees would increase, allowing for a much smoother and manageable transition during the expected high turnover.
