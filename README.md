Retiring Employees:

In the first analysis, we determined how many employees were born between 1952 and 1955 and are therefore, nearing retirement age. When running the code, we can see that:
-Over 72,000 employees will be retiring in the next few years.
-Of the employees retiring, many hold senior level positions, with “senior engineer” and “senior staff” being the job titles with the highest rate of upcoming retirement.

Mentorship Program

The second analysis is used to determine which employees are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. When executing this code, it is shown that:
-1,549 employees are eligible for this program.
-The majority of the eligible employees also hold a senior level position.

Summary

In this analysis, we were tasked with answering two questions: How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

There are 72,458 job openings that will need to be filled in the next few years. There are 1,549 employees that are mentorship eligible, which is not enough employees in each department able to help mentor the next generation.
